# Image Augmentation and Bounding Box Adjustment

This project includes scripts to perform image augmentation (zoom) and adjust bounding boxes accordingly for a dataset of images. It processes all images in the specified directories, applies zoom augmentation, updates bounding boxes, and saves the results.

## Directory Structure

- `20_times_dataset_picture`: Directory containing the original images.
- `obj_train_data`: Directory containing the original bounding box annotations in YOLO format.
- `output_annotations`: Directory where the new bounding box annotations will be saved.
- `output_image_annotations`: Directory where the zoomed images will be saved.
- `result_preview`: Directory where the final images with bounding boxes drawn will be saved.
